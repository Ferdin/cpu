## NEXT: Section 2 - Flags and Arithmetic ⭐ (I am here!)

Time: 1-2 hours
Learn:

Carry flag (for addition/subtraction overflow)
ADC (Add with Carry)
SBC (Subtract with Carry)
CLC (Clear Carry)
SEC (Set Carry)

This builds directly on what you know (flags) and is essential for real programs.

## Section 3 - The Stack

Time: 1-2 hours
Learn:

What the stack is (a special memory area)
Stack Pointer (SP register)
PHA/PLA (Push/Pull Accumulator)
PHP/PLP (Push/Pull Processor Status)
How JSR/RTS use the stack for subroutines

The stack is like a stack of plates - you can only add/remove from the top!

## Section 4 - Overflow Flag and Signed Arithmetic

Time: 1 hour
Learn:

Overflow flag (for signed number overflow)
BVC/BVS (Branch on overflow)
The difference between Carry (unsigned) and Overflow (signed)

This completes your understanding of all the flags.

## Section 5 - Logical Operations

Time: 1 hour
Learn:

AND (combine bits)
ORA (OR bits together)
EOR (XOR - exclusive OR)
BIT (test bits)

These are used for bit manipulation - turning on/off individual bits.

## Section 6 - Shifts and Rotates

Time: 1 hour
Learn:

ASL (shift left - multiply by 2)
LSR (shift right - divide by 2)
ROL (rotate left)
ROR (rotate right)

## Section 7 - All Addressing Modes

Time: 2-3 hours
Learn the remaining addressing modes:

Absolute,X and Absolute,Y
Indirect,X and Indirect,Y
Zero Page,X and Zero Page,Y

This lets you access arrays and data structures.

## Section 8 - Memory Management

Time: 2 hours
Learn:

How NES memory is organized
Memory-mapped I/O
Mirroring
Building a proper Bus class

## Section 9 - The PPU (Graphics)

Time: Many hours!
This is the big one - learning how the NES displays graphics.
